The college said it removed students from practicum last week at the request of its health-care work placement organizations to help the health-care system focus on the demands of COVID-19.   42 new cases of COVID-19 reported in Alberta, pushing total to 301   'We're skilled and ready to work' Nursing student Morgan Winn had three and a half weeks left in her practicum before she would qualify to apply for a temporary licence and work as a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) in Alberta.  Winn believes accommodations should be made so that she and other students who were set to graduate next month can put their skills to use during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not like we're unequipped to go and help. We're skilled and ready to work,"" she said. ""It's important people realize we're not at the beginning of our nursing journey, we're weeks away from graduation … we were just in the clinics and hospitals working, using our skills for good."" 'We're the hands, let us help' Fellow nursing student Chris McKelvie said now, more than ever, the health-care system needs all hands on deck. ""We are the hands, so let us help. We're basically just sitting at home twiddling our thumbs waiting to do something really good,"" he said. ""We paid a lot of good money to become a nurse, and now that they need them more than ever, they're not letting us help. It's very frustrating."" 'Move learners back into the system' Nora MacLachlan, dean of Bow Valley's School of Health and Wellness, said the college agrees that these students —who are close to graduating and in good academic standing — should be in the field as soon as possible. But, in the immediate days following the declaration of the pandemic and local state of emergency, she said the college needed to act. ""We needed to just pull back and allow our health-care system to regroup, and do that with without having hundreds of learners coming to their place with varying levels of education and knowledge at particular times in their programs,"" said MacLachlan.  ""We've taken everyone out of the placements for now and we're looking at ways that we can strategically — and in an organized fashion — have learners move back into the system."" Winn said late last week she wrote a letter to the premier and started a petition seeking the school and regulators to consider either allowing students to complete their hours for graduation, fast track those weeks away from graduating, or exempt them from the final graduation criteria ""in this time of medical crisis."" As of Monday evening, the online petition had nearly 4,000 signatures.  'It's really about meeting those learning outcomes' Winn said students need answers, and the communication between students and the college hasn't provided all the answers they're asking. ""The last email we got said students who worked 120 hours would be given two credits and then would be allowed to finish the remaining hours after COVID-19 blew over,"" said Winn. ""They didn't address the students with under 120 hours which makes us believe that they would have to restart their entire preceptorship."" But MacLachlan said in these circumstances it's about more than just hours.   ""Last week in our former world — [in that] way of doing things it was easy to just look at it in terms of hours,"" she said. ""But it's really about meeting those learning outcomes and the competencies that reflect their level of ability and capability when it comes to standards of care and standards of practice.""  Right now, MacLachlan said the focus is on making sure standards are maintained when those students are able to enter the workforce.  ""We're gathering data from evaluations that may have been written about the learners and putting that information into some organized data [so] that we can then look at potential flexibility around how they're meeting those outcomes,"" she said. ""It might not look like it used to look but we will definitely be really looking at that competency and how they're meeting that competency."" 'Working toward that' MacLachlan the college is currently working closely with regulators including the College of Licensed Practical Nurses in Alberta on ways they can best accommodate students and get them in the field. ""We're absolutely working toward that. We just are in the first week of this crisis and what we don't need is a crisis in the crisis,"" she said. MacLachlan said she hopes to have things figured out so she can update students soon, and offer any help and resources they can to Alberta Health Services.  ""One of the ways that we can help is to offer our learners who would like to be in those places and have met the learning outcome where they can actually help facilitate what's happening in there,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bow-valley-college-nursing-1.5507462

Officials in California's Placer County, near Sacramento, said Wednesday an elderly person who tested positive after returning from a San Francisco-to-Mexico cruise had died. The victim had underlying health problems, authorities said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom late Wednesday declared a statewide emergency due to coronavirus. Washington and Florida had already declared emergencies, and Hawaii also joined them Wednesday. Washington also announced another death, bringing its total to 10. Most of those who died were residents of Life Care Center, a nursing home in Kirkland, a suburb east of Seattle. At least 39 cases have been reported in the Seattle area, where researchers say the virus may have been circulating undetected for weeks. Vice President Mike Pence was expected to meet with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee near Olympia on Thursday. Seema Verma, head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the agency is sending inspectors to Life Care along with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out what happened and determine whether the nursing home followed guidelines for preventing infections. Last April, the state fined Life Care $67,000 US over infection-control deficiencies following two flu outbreaks that affected 17 patients and staff.

While the state and Seattle have declared emergencies, giving leaders broad powers to suspend activities, they have not issued any orders to do so.

""Right now, we are deferring to the judgment ... of these organizations."" While some individual schools and businesses have shut down, the governor said large-scale school closings have not been ordered because ""there are so many ramifications for families and businesses,"" especially for health-care workers who might not be able to go to work because of child care responsibilities.

What happens to the arena after that is up to the city, which owns the entire property.","For a decade now, Stéfan Marquis has been trekking across the city from his home in Old Montreal three to four nights a week to play hockey in a rundown arena managed by the YMCA. ""The arena in Hochelaga is one of the few on the island that actually offers hockey time for adults,"" he said. ""This one is the crown jewel of arenas."" Most arenas run by the city are geared toward youngsters. That's not a bad thing, Marquis said, but adults need exercise, too. So when Marquis heard earlier this week that the arena might be closing, he launched an online petition to keep the ice rink open. In a city that revolves around hockey, the petition caught on fast, garnering nearly 6,000 signatures in four days. On Wednesday, the YMCA made it official: it's shuttering three Montreal YMCA locations as a cost-cutting measure, including the old schoolhouse in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that's been home to the neighbourhood Y since 1980, along with the rickety arena next door. The YMCA building will close on Dec. 31, although Y officials said the arena will stay open until the end of the hockey season. What happens to the arena after that is up to the city, which owns the entire property. Borough taken by surprise Marquis's petition is addressed to Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, and he will bring it to her office next week since Montreal owns the property. A spokesperson for the borough of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Julie Bellemare, said there are no plans yet for the schoolhouse or arena. The YMCA has been located in the old city-owned schoolhouse since 1980, offering a range of services, including a weight room, pool and arena.  (Jennifer Yoon/CBC) ""Our priority is to preserve the services available to affected citizens in the borough,"" Bellemare said. She said the borough is working with the YMCA to seek out alternative venues for ""the programs most relevant to the community."" What will happen to the YMCA property will be part of a reflection on sports and recreation in the borough as a whole and in the Hochelaga neighbourhood, she said. Hot market for developers But Marquis doesn't want to wait. He wants Plante to step in before it's too late. He's heard plenty of talk that developers are already eyeing the property, as the area is ripe for gentrification. Right next door to the arena is a modern housing complex that stands in sharp contrast to the neighbourhood's more modest homes. It's a hot location, just steps from the Olympic Park, two Metro stations and the Marché Maisonneuve. The Hochelaga YMCA's arena is located just off Hochelaga Street, at the corner of Aird Avenue, about one block from the Olympic Stadium. (Jennifer Yoon/CBC) Marquis's biggest fear is that the city will sell the arena to a developer rather than spend the money to bring it up to modern standards. ""The structure might be a little outdated and it might need a bit more than a renovation,"" said Marquis, who is an architect. ""But just completely getting rid of the ice rink and not replacing it or not trying to find a solution for us is just devastating."" Hard but necessary decision The YMCA pays the city a nominal rent for the old school and arena, in exchange for covering the cost of renovations and repairs As far as the YMCA is concerned, those costs are now just too high, said Stéphane Vaillancourt, CEO of the YMCAs of Québec. Montreal skaters light up the Olympic Stadium's new bowl — a first for the city The building has a pool, weight room, dance studio, locker rooms and gymnasium, attached to the arena. That arena's freon refrigeration system is outdated and expensive to run, he said, and fees from the membership base isn't covering the overhead. ""The members have been very, very loyal to the YMCA over time,"" Vaillancourt said. ""It's really a question of how can we maintain a building of that size with the revenues that are generated? Unfortunately, it just doesn't balance."" As a hockey player himself, Vaillancourt said he understands how attached players can be to their arenas. Beyond that, he said, he knows how much the Hochelaga Y means to the community, but he has to ensure the organization stays in good financial health. It might be old and have a leaky roof, but there's much love in the community for the YMCA-run hockey arena in Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. (Jennifer Yoon/CBC) ""It's not a pleasant experience to announce this kind of decision to our staff and volunteers who have been there for so many years, having a great impact and changing people's lives in that community,"" he said. ""We have been trying for years and years to improve the financial situation of that building and the others."" The YMCA is a charity, and although the decision was heart-wrenching for both him and the board, the organization needs to remain sustainable to continue offering services at all 40 locations in Quebec. The hope, Vaillancourt said, is to renew the YMCA's presence in Hochelaga, by offering some programs to the community at smaller locations throughout the district. 'Truncating a way of life' Marquis does not want this hockey season to be his last at the Hochelaga arena. His hope is the city will find a way to preserve it — perhaps applying for a government grant to replace the greenhouse gas-emitting freon system with an environmentally sustainable refrigerated rink. Quebec cancels bass-thumping, house-shaking electronic music festival at Big O Keeping the arena open is important to the regulars, both young and old, said Marquis. He described the looming closure as ""truncating a way of life."" ""If I had real alternatives, maybe I wouldn't feel so bad about it,"" he said, citing the difficulty of booking ice time throughout the city.

He said the school board should have told those attending Riverdale sooner about the impending closure. ""I'm really surprised that they didn't inform parents and teachers and all the community. They are saying we will have to respect this institution, but in fact they didn't do their job and they didn't inform or explain or consult anybody,"" he said on CBC Montreal's Daybreak. ""Sometimes I have to take tough decisions, and this is one of them."" The CSMB and LPSB have been in talks over the last two years about how to deal with overcrowding in the French-language board. Listen to Riverdale High School students talk about the closure of their school.  Riverdale and Lindsay Place High School in Pointe-Claire began housing some of those overflow students from the CSMB earlier this year. Riverdale was at about half its capacity, said Christopher Skeete, the CAQ's parliamentary secretary responsible for relations with the English-speaking community. Derraji said he's concerned that the quality of education will suffer at the new English school, which is combining students from Riverdale and Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School after the CSMB takes over Riverdale's building this summer. POINT/COUNTERPOINTShould Riverdale stay in the English system? Two parents have their say He wants the government to have a dialogue with parents, students and teachers to see if there is a better solution and to ensure that another school isn't closed in the same fashion. ""This school, it's very important to the community,"" he said. He also wants more investment from the government to open new schools to meet the needs of the overcrowded French system.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/riverdale-high-school-petition-1.5023394

Fifteen-year-old Coalhurst, Alta., resident Ryan Slingerland launched the petition in reaction to Bill C-71, which would require gun retailers to retain records of firearms inventory and sales for at least two decades.  It would also require the seller to validate the firearms licence of the purchaser, and increase background checks for anyone wanting to buy a gun.  Liberals propose tightening Canada's firearms law with new record-keeping practices Alberta firearm enthusiasts say Canada has 'too much gun control,' decry proposed legislation  Slingerland believes the bill is both misguided and duplicates restrictions already in place, making it redundant before it even passes through the House of Commons. ""Stores are already registering these guns, they're already keeping this information,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, what this bill is proposing is already being done — so it's [ultimately] just making it a useless bill. ""I saw the new regulations would focus on law-abiding gun owners, while we could be tackling firearm violence from a much different angle, such as policing,"" Slingerland said in an interview with The Homestretch Tuesday.  He disputed the notion that Bill C-71 will make the country safer by placing greater checks and balances on who is able to purchase firearms. ""There are currently good checks in place for purchasing firearm. This bill will add further red tape on law abiding gun owners and will bring back an ineffective long-gun registry. ""Law abiding citizens are not the issue with gun violence,"" he added. ""The thing is, if a criminal wants a gun, they're not going to register it."" 'There's a lot of support behind it' Slingerland's petition urging the government to scrap C-71 has the backing of Lethbridge MP Rachael Harder. It turns out a lot of Canadians agree with him as well. Slingerland said the majority of signatures on his petition have come from Ontario, followed by Alberta and then the rest of Canada. ""It's pretty incredible to see how passionate Canadians are about this issue,"" he said. ""Not just in this area, but nationally. ""You see online — and I hear it at school as well — there's a lot of support behind it."" He also pointed out that there is a vast difference between gun control laws in Canada and in the U.S., where high school students have taken to the streets calling for stricter gun controls following the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. ""In the U.S., they don't have same background checks that we have,"" he said. ""We have much stricter rules. ""And our firearm violence isn't the same as they are [either],"" he added.  Slingerland's father was a municipal politician for seven years, and the teen says he's interested in the idea of running for office one day. He's currently part of his school student council. ""I'm interested in politics and how the government works. This is also a clear example of how people can be involved in politics with not having to be in them,"" he said. ""Petitions are a great way for youth to voice their opinions on issues in Ottawa as they are not allowed to vote.""
